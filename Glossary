* DNS Cache Poisoning	A local cache of information being manipulated by attackers.

* Execute	You can open a file and execute code and os binaries against it.
* Group	The owner or Interacting entity on file may be part of a group that has a set of permissions per their grouping. A group can have read-only, write, or execute privileges.

* IP Reputation	A database of known IP addresses used in past attacks.
* IPv6	The newest version of Internet Protocol.

* Network	This is one of the main protocols used in monitoring and where IPv4 and IPv6 are found. This is where your IP address is found. You will do a lot of commands that have to do with IPv4. This layer deals with routing, addressing, and traffic control.
OU	Organizational Unit
* Owner	Entity that owns the file. Sometimes the creator is the owner. Creators can read, write, and execute.
* Physical	Transmission and reception of data via a physical medium, Examples of this are Ethernet which is usually what most current LAN networks are based on, and WiFi which coexist with LANs pretty much everywhere.
