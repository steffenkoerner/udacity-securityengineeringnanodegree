# Infrastructure Security

Infrastructure security is about securing the network from attacks.


## MITRE ATT&CK
Mitre ATT&CK is a framework and matrix that includes tools, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors.

* Initial Access: entry vectors to gain a foothold in newly compromised systems.
* Execution: perform actions on compromised systems.
* Persistence: maintain access in compromised systems.
* Privilege Escalation: assume higher rights within compromised systems.
* Defense Evasion: bypass controls inside the victim system.
* Credential Access: obtain credentials from compromised systems.
* Discovery: find new possible targets and data within compromised systems.
* Lateral Movementt: move around compromised systems.
* Collection: gather information elements from compromised systems.
* Exfiltration: take data out of the targeted victim.
* Impact: how it affects victim organization/environment.

## CIS Benchmarks
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) is a non-profit organisation with a mission to “make the connected world a safer place by developing, validating, and promoting timely best practice solutions against pervasive cyber threats”. CIS uses a consensus process to release benchmarks to safeguard organisations against cyber attacks

CIS Benchmarks provide configuration baselines on how to configure a specific system release securely.
They can be found here: [CIS Benchmarks](https://learn.cisecurity.org/benchmarks)

An exanple CIS Benchmarks - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS v2.0.1

CIS 1.5.1 Ensure permissions on boot loader config are configured
Level 1 - Server
Level 1 - Workstation
Audit: Verify UID & GID are both 0/root and Access does not grant permissions to group or other:

stat /boot/grub/grub.cfg
Remediation: chown root:root /boot/grub/grub.cfg

## Firewall
On linux the firewall status can be checked with:  sudo ufw status

## WAF Web Application Firewall
Serves the same function of a firewall but focused on HTTP traffic, web services.It contains protection against injection attacks (SQL Injection, NoSQL, OS, etc.).
The most popular open-source WAF is ModSecurity.

## Monitoring Network Traffic
Network traffic can be captured with tools like wireshark and tcpdump

## Encrypt Traffic

### IPSec
More specifically, IPsec is a group of protocols that are used together to set up secure connections between devices at layer 3 of the OSI model (the network layer). IPsec accomplishes this by scrambling all messages so that only authorized parties can understand them — a process known as encryption. IPsec is often used to set up virtual private networks (VPNs).
### SSL
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a protocol for encrypting HTTP traffic, such as connections between user devices and web servers. 
### SSL vs IPSec
One of the major differences between SSL and IPsec is which layer of the OSI model each one belongs to. The OSI model is an abstract representation, broken into "layers," of the processes that make the Internet work.

The IPsec protocol suite operates at the network layer of the OSI model. It runs directly on top of IP (the Internet Protocol), which is responsible for routing data packets.

Meanwhile, SSL operates at the application layer of the OSI model. It encrypts HTTP traffic instead of directly encrypting IP packets.

## Top 8 Security Failures
Top Security Failures

* Exposed Services
    *Anonymous access to Access Server with FTP Server.
* Unnecessary Accounts, Excessive Permissions
    * Guest accounts enabled with access to company file servers.
* Denial of Service
    * Business Application Server is taken down by attackers.
* Unpatched, Outdated Vulnerable Services, Applications
    * Outdated Desktop computers infected with Ransomware.
* Weak access controls, exposed credentials
    * The developer places remote access credentials in the code repository.
* No backup or disaster recovery plan
    * Hardware failure causes the company's data loss.
* Unknown services, applications, and assets running inside the perimeterr
    * Users running crypto mining software.
* No basic AV, Operating Systems, Firewall Protections
    * Computer Worm takes over all desktops.

## Nmap Modes
Nmap NSE Categories

Category	Function
* Auth	Use or Bypass Authentication Credentials.
* Broadcast	Uses broadcast technique to discover hosts not found in normal Nmap discovery operations.
* Brute	Uses Brute Force Attacks to guess credentials.
* Default	series of scripts grouped according to specific criteria and run by default using mmap -Sc host or network CIDR.
* Discovery	Specific discovery tasks addressing services such as SNMP, or Directory Services, or SMB enumeration.
* DoS	Scripts that will replicate denial of service attacks.
* Exploit	Scripts that execute exploits.
* External	These scripts may send requests to third parties, or other network resources.
* Fuzzer	Sends server software unexpected or randomized fields in each packet.
* Intrusive	High-risk script that is likely to crash services.
* Malware	Tests a platform to see if it is infected with malware or a backdoor.
* Safe	Scripts designed not to crash services.
* Version	Scripts that extend detection capabilities.
* Vuln	Checks for specific types of vulnerabilities.
