The remotesec process is stared from the etc/darklord.sh script. This will also be removed in addition to the remotesec process.

I found the process by grepping in the /var/syslog for darklord, where I found the /etc/darklord.sh script. By checking this script I saw
that it starts the remotesec process.
I wouldn't have found this file easily if the name has not been darklord.

What are the steps to find the process by using the HIDS GUI and how to find it with command line tool?
