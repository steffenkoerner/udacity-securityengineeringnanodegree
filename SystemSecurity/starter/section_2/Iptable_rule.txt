# Provide your IPtables rule to block SSH access to the attacking IP address.

iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.56.1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP

In general I would restrict the ip adress more as I know it belongs to an attacker. Thus I would drop all incoming connections fromt he ip with
the following command.

iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.56.1 -j DROP
