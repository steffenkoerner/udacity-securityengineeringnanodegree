# Infrastructure Security

Infrastructure security is about securing the network from attacks.


## MITRE ATT&CK
Mitre ATT&CK is a framework and matrix that includes tools, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors.

* Initial Access: entry vectors to gain a foothold in newly compromised systems.
* Execution: perform actions on compromised systems.
* Persistence: maintain access in compromised systems.
* Privilege Escalation: assume higher rights within compromised systems.
* Defense Evasion: bypass controls inside the victim system.
* Credential Access: obtain credentials from compromised systems.
* Discovery: find new possible targets and data within compromised systems.
* Lateral Movementt: move around compromised systems.
* Collection: gather information elements from compromised systems.
* Exfiltration: take data out of the targeted victim.
* Impact: how it affects victim organization/environment.

## CIS Benchmarks
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) is a non-profit organisation with a mission to “make the connected world a safer place by developing, validating, and promoting timely best practice solutions against pervasive cyber threats”. CIS uses a consensus process to release benchmarks to safeguard organisations against cyber attacks

CIS Benchmarks provide configuration baselines on how to configure a specific system release securely.
They can be found here: [CIS Benchmarks](https://learn.cisecurity.org/benchmarks)

An exanple CIS Benchmarks - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS v2.0.1

CIS 1.5.1 Ensure permissions on boot loader config are configured
Level 1 - Server
Level 1 - Workstation
Audit: Verify UID & GID are both 0/root and Access does not grant permissions to group or other:

stat /boot/grub/grub.cfg
Remediation: chown root:root /boot/grub/grub.cfg

## Firewall

On linux the firewall status can be checked with:  sudo ufw status

## WAF Web Application Firewall
Serves the same function of a firewall but focused on HTTP traffic, web services.It contains protection against injection attacks (SQL Injection, NoSQL, OS, etc.).
The most popular open-source WAF is ModSecurity.
